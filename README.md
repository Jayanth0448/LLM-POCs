## Project 3 : Transforms Python source code into optimized C++
- **Python-to-C++ Code Converter**: Transforms Python source code into optimized C++ using LLMs (GPT or Claude) to enhance performance and efficiency.  
- **LLM Selection & Code Execution**: Allows users to choose between GPT or Claude for conversion, then compile and run the C++ output to verify results.  
- **Performance Boost & Output Validation**: Generates faster executables by leveraging C++ optimization, with built-in tools to compare outputs and benchmark speed improvements.
